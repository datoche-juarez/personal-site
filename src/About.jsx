    <h1>About Us:</h1>

    <p>
      Our mission is to remove the barriers that stand between those that have
      had interactions with the criminal justice system and the opportunity to
      pursuit a healthy life, specifically employment opportunities and housing.
      The denial of these opportunities to those that have repaid their debt to
      society is not only cruel, but it also actively inhibits the reintegration
      process. This destructive cycle does not function, not for the individual,
      and not for our communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a time when millions of Americans are asking what they can do to be a
      part of the solution, and are looking for opportunities to work towards
      tangible results, we are working to create a space for those who have
      previously been denied the most basic of freedoms to connect with places
      of business and landlords who have made a commitment to move beyond
      denying opportunities to those with criminal records. Our hope is that
      everyone with the desire and the willingness has the chance to better
      their lives and that our communities will reap the rewards of healthier,
      more inclusive, and more productive society.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you own have a place of business or a rental property and believe in
      our mission, please contact us to be added to our list of resources.
      Although our goal is to begin building our network in the Metro Detroit
      area, we hope to expand further as this project picks up momentum. Head
      over to our contact page to join our movement.
