      Should everyone with a criminal record really be serving a life sentence?
      Does the punishment ever end? Does it discourage crime and make us safer,
      or does it perpetuate our staggering recidivism rates? When will we end
      this madness and what can we do to be a part of the solution? People
      deserve a chance to change their lives and become active participants in
      our society. By denying them these opportunities, we are discouraging
      change and limiting their opportunity to pursue a better life.

      Although crime victimization rates have been decreasing in the United
      States, government spending on policing continues to increase.
      Simultaneously our prison population continues to increase, destroying the
      lives of countless Americans, who after serving lengthy jail or prison
      sentences, completing probation or parole, and paying hefty fines and
      restitution, are still increasingly finding themselves pushed out of their
      communities. Many employers and landlords have strict policies which
      prevent former offenders from being able to secure employment or housing.

      We have all heard the shocking statistic: while only having 5% of the
      world’s overall population, the US has 25% of the world’s prison
      population. What fewer people realize is that although crime victimization
      rates have been decreasing, government spending on policing, at the
      federal, state, and local level, continue increasing. The path we have
      taken as a nation has been a failure. Many of us accept this fact and push
      it to the back of our conscience, hoping that someday, when the conditions
      are right, we will work towards criminal justice reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time for action is now. With renewed support for criminal justice
      reform, and during a time of national reflection around the issues of
      policing and crime, we are presented with an opportunity to re-envision a
      rational and functional response to crime, one in which justice and
      rehabilitation are centered, and where the goal is freedom, for our
      communities, and those that have worked hard but have long had it denied
      to them.
