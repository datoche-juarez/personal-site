    <p>
      Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently a Computer Science
      student with an Associate of Applied Sciences in Computer Information
      Systems from Henry Ford College continuing my education in pursuit of a
      Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I created this site not only to
      showcase the projects I have been a part of, but as a way to connect with
      people. My goal is to continue pursuing my dreams and have some
      interesting experiences along the way.
